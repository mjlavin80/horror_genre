Click on any .ipynb file to render it in Github. The Notebook files with something worth seeing so far are:

1. [Analysis of Walker's Dictionary and "Walker Ratios" of Underwood Corpus](https://github.com/mjlavin80/horror_genre/blob/master/Walker's%20Dictionary.ipynb)
2. [Approximate Reproduction of Underwood-Sellers Dictionary.com Results](https://github.com/mjlavin80/horror_genre/blob/master/Dictionary.com%20Results.ipynb)
3. [OED Cross-Validation] (https://github.com/mjlavin80/horror_genre/blob/master/OED%20Results.ipynb)
4. [Perhaps Overly Lengthy Explanation of OED Webscraping and Normalization] (https://github.com/mjlavin80/horror_genre/blob/master/oed_normalize.ipynb)

Eventually I will also update the "Machine Learning" notebook with various results.
